Nordic nRF Connect SDK Integration Guide
########################################

This guide walks through integrating the Hubble Network dual-stack Satellite
and BLE application with the `nRF Connect SDK`_ (NCS).
NCS is Nordic Semiconductor's production-ready SDK built on top of the Zephyr
RTOS, and is the recommended platform for Nordic nRF52, nRF53, and nRF54 Series
devices.

By the end of this guide you will know how to:

* Integrate the Hubble Satellite and Terrestrial (BLE) network stacks into an
  NCS application.
* Obtain ephemeris data and use pass prediction to schedule satellite
  transmissions.
* Transmit data to the Hubble satellite network from a Nordic device.

Supported NCS Version and Boards
*********************************

The Hubble Device SDK currently supports **NCS v3.4.0**. If you require
support for a different version, `contact us <mailto:support@hubble.com>`_.

Nordic nRF52, nRF53, and nRF54 Series SoCs are supported. The SDK includes
board API implementations for the following development kits out of the box:

For custom boards, refer to the :ref:`board bring-up <ncs_sat_board_bringup>`
section.

Prerequisites
*************

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

* **A supported development kit or custom board** with a PA or FEM capable of
  at least +20 dBm transmit output power. The Hubble satellite link budget
  requires this minimum output to reach the network reliably.
* **An antenna tuned to the Hubble satellite frequency band**, connected to
  the RF output of the PA or FEM.
* **A Hubble account and API key** to fetch ephemeris data for pass prediction.
  See :ref:`Create your Hubble Account <ncs_sat_hubble_account>` below.
* **ADALM-PLUTO SDR** *(optional, recommended for custom board bring-up)*:
  used to verify RF output at the physical layer. Available from common
  distributors such as DigiKey and Mouser. See the `ADALM-PLUTO product page`_
  for details, and :ref:`Next Steps <ncs_sat_next_steps>` for the verification
  workflow.

.. _ncs_sat_hubble_account:

Create your Hubble Account
**************************

A Hubble account is required to access the Hubble Dashboard and generate an
API key for fetching ephemeris data used in pass prediction.

#. Create an account at the `Hubble Dashboard`_.
#. Once logged in, follow the `Hubble Platform API documentation`_ to
   authenticate and generate your API key.

Keep your API key accessible. It is used later in this guide when fetching
orbital parameters for pass prediction.

SDK Setup
*********

Install the NCS Toolchain
=========================

Follow the `NCS installation guide`_ to install the NCS toolchain and
all required dependencies before proceeding.

Add Hubble Network to an Existing NCS Project
=============================================

If you already have an NCS workspace, add the Hubble Device SDK as a West
module by including the following in your project's sub-manifest or
``west.yml``:

.. TODO: Update ``revision`` from ``main`` to the satellite release tag once
   the first tagged satellite release is available.

.. code-block:: yaml

   manifest:
     remotes:
       - name: hubble
         url-base: https://github.com/HubbleNetwork
     projects:
       - name: hubblenetwork-sdk
         repo-path: hubble-device-sdk
         revision: main
         path: modules/lib/hubblenetwork-sdk
         remote: hubble

Then run:

.. code-block:: bash

   west update hubblenetwork-sdk

Initialize a New Workspace
==========================

To start a fresh workspace with Hubble Network as the manifest repository,
use the ``west-ncs.yml`` to import NCS:

.. code-block:: bash

   west init -m git@github.com:HubbleNetwork/hubble-device-sdk.git \
       --mf west-ncs.yml ~/hubblenetwork-workspace
   cd ~/hubblenetwork-workspace
   west update

Fetch the Satellite Radio Blobs
================================

The satellite radio port for Nordic SoCs relies on prebuilt libraries
distributed as West blobs. These are required for the satellite stack to
build and must be fetched explicitly:

.. code-block:: bash

   west blobs fetch hubblenetwork-sdk

The blobs are placed under ``modules/lib/hubblenetwork-sdk/zephyr/blobs/``
and linked automatically when ``CONFIG_HUBBLE_SAT_NETWORK=y`` is set for a
supported Nordic board.

.. note::

   If you skip this step, the build will fail with a missing library error
   when ``CONFIG_HUBBLE_SAT_NETWORK=y`` is enabled.


.. _ncs_sat_board_bringup:

Board Bring-Up
**************

If you are using one of the supported development kits from the
`Supported NCS Version and Boards`_ section, skip ahead to
:ref:`Project Configuration <ncs_sat_project_config>`.

For custom boards, this section walks through implementing the satellite
board API using the nRF21540 DK as a concrete example. If your board does
not yet have a Zephyr board definition, follow the
`Zephyr board porting guide`_ first before proceeding.

The full board API contract and integration checklist are documented in
:ref:`board_support`. This section focuses on the NCS/Zephyr path.

.. note::

   **nRF53 (dual-core) boards:** The nRF5340 has a dedicated network core
   (Cortex-M33) for radio activity and an application core for application
   logic. The satellite and BLE radio stacks run on the network core, while
   your application runs on the application core. Communication between the
   two cores requires IPC.

   When building for an nRF53 target, use ``sysbuild`` to compile both cores'
   firmware in a single build invocation. For a complete dual-core project
   structure with IPC wiring and application/network core split, see the
   `Hubble Thingy:53 reference application`_.

Implementing the Board API
==========================

Create a ``.c`` file for your board and implement the four functions declared
in ``port/zephyr/sat_board.h``. The nRF21540 DK implementation at
``port/zephyr/boards/nordic/nrf52/nrf21540dk.c`` is used as the reference
throughout.

.. note::

   A common FEM implementation uses generic two-pin PA/LNA control, such as
   a Skyworks SKY66112-11 or similar. See
   ``port/zephyr/boards/nordic/nrf52/fem.c`` for a reference on how these
   routines are implemented.

:c:func:`hubble_sat_board_init`
--------------------------------

Called once during SDK initialization. Initialize your board hardware here:
GPIOs, PA/FEM configuration, and any static power defaults:

.. code-block:: c

   int hubble_sat_board_init(void)
   {
       /* Initialize your board hardware here, e.g. PA/FEM GPIOs. */
       hubble_board_fem_setup();
       return 0;
   }

:c:func:`hubble_sat_board_enable`
----------------------------------

Called before each transmission window. Enable your board's RF components,
setting power to the right level (+20 dBm) before handing off to the SoC layer:

.. code-block:: c

   int hubble_sat_board_enable(void)
   {
       /* Enable your board hardware here */
       return hubble_sat_soc_enable();
   }

:c:func:`hubble_sat_board_disable`
-----------------------------------

Called after each transmission window. Disable your RF components and return
the board to its idle state:

.. code-block:: c

   int hubble_sat_board_disable(void)
   {
       /* Disable your board hardware here */
       return hubble_sat_soc_disable();
   }

:c:func:`hubble_sat_board_packet_send`
---------------------------------------

Called by the SDK for each transmission, including retries. Enable the PA/FEM
path before transmission and put it back to sleep/bypass afterwards:

.. code-block:: c

   int hubble_sat_board_packet_send(const struct hubble_sat_packet_frames *packet)
   {
       int ret;

       /* Enable your PA/FEM before transmitting. */
       board_fem_enable();

       /* 
        * Optional: default power for each SoC is 0 dBm,
        * however, the board may and can set the SoC radio power
        * to a higher level supported by the SoC based on the gain
        * of the PA/FEM to reach +20 dBm output.
        * e.g. nrf_radio_txpower_set(NRF_RADIO, desired_power_level);
        */
       board_fem_set_power_level(desired_power_level);

       /* Call the SoC layer to handle packet transmission */
       ret = hubble_sat_soc_packet_send(packet);
       if (ret != 0) {
           /* Handle error */
       }

       /* Optional: if power level was set, restore previous power level */
       board_fem_set_power_level(previous_power_level);

       /* Return PA/FEM to sleep/bypass after transmission. */
       board_fem_sleep();

       return ret;
   }

Register the Board in the Build System
=======================================

Your board source file, which includes the PA/FEM setup routines and the
board API implementation above, must be registered with the Zephyr build
system. This can be done from within the SDK's ``port/zephyr/boards/``
directory or from within your application's own source tree as an out-of-tree
module.

Conditioned on your board's Kconfig symbol, add the following to the relevant
``CMakeLists.txt``. Using the nRF21540 DK as an example:

.. code-block:: cmake

   if(CONFIG_BOARD_NRF21540DK_NRF52840)
       zephyr_include_directories(
           ${ZEPHYR_BASE}/subsys/bluetooth/controller/ll_sw/nordic/hal/nrf5/radio/
       )
       zephyr_library_sources(fem.c)
       zephyr_library_sources(nrf21540dk.c)
   endif()

Replace ``CONFIG_BOARD_NRF21540DK_NRF52840`` with the Kconfig symbol for your
board (``CONFIG_BOARD_<YOUR_BOARD>``), and list your FEM and board source
files accordingly. The prebuilt satellite radio blob for the SoC family is
linked automatically by the existing SDK SoC ``CMakeLists.txt``.


.. _ncs_sat_project_config:

Project Configuration
*********************

Enable the Hubble dual-stack by adding the following to your ``prj.conf``:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   CONFIG_HUBBLE_BLE_NETWORK=y
   CONFIG_HUBBLE_SAT_NETWORK=y

   # Set to your oscillator's PPM rating (check your crystal datasheet)
   CONFIG_HUBBLE_SAT_NETWORK_DEVICE_TDR=10

``CONFIG_HUBBLE_SAT_NETWORK_DEVICE_TDR`` sets the clock drift rate of your
oscillator in parts per million (PPM). Configuring this correctly ensures the
SDK adds the right number of retransmissions to compensate for accumulated
clock drift since the last time sync. An incorrect value reduces satellite
delivery probability. See :ref:`hubble_satellite_clock_drift` for a detailed
explanation.

For the full set of available options, see :ref:`hubble_configuration`.

Other common options for a dual-stack application:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # Bluetooth
   CONFIG_BT=y
   CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL=y

   # Satellite pass windows can be 12+ hours away,
   # so we need a 64-bit timeout to avoid overflow.
   CONFIG_TIMEOUT_64BIT=y

   # Optional: enable FPU if supported
   CONFIG_FPU=y


.. _ncs_sat_data_requirements:

Preparing for Satellite Transmission
*************************************

The satellite stack requires three inputs before it can schedule and transmit:

* **Unix time**: used for pass prediction and key derivation
* **Device location**: latitude and longitude, used to compute satellite passes
* **Orbital parameters**: satellite ephemeris data describing each satellite's
  orbit

How these are provisioned is up to the application.

Time
====

Many approaches work: BLE provisioning from a phone, NTP over Wi-Fi, GPS, an
RTC, or reading from persistent storage across reboots. See
:ref:`hubble_timing` for best practices and trade-offs.

Location
========

If the device is deployed at a fixed location, latitude and longitude can be
hard-coded directly in firmware:

.. code-block:: c

   struct hubble_sat_device_pos device_pos = {
       .lat = 47.6,
       .lon = -122.3,
   };

For mobile devices, location can be obtained from an onboard GPS module if
present, or provisioned at runtime from a companion app. For example,
delivered over BLE from a phone/gateway that has GPS access.

Orbital Parameters
==================

Orbital parameters describe each satellite's orbit and are used by
:c:func:`hubble_sat_next_pass_get` to predict when a satellite will be
visible from the device location.

Since Hubble satellites are station-keeping, orbital parameters are stable
enough to be baked into firmware at build time. Use the
``tools/orbital_params_fetch.py`` helper to fetch current parameters from the
Hubble API and generate a ``sat_params.c`` file ready to compile into your
application:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HUBBLE_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
   python tools/orbital_params_fetch.py path/to/output

.. TODO: Add recommended maximum age for baked-in orbital parameters before
   a firmware update is needed to refresh them.

See :ref:`hubble_satellite_orbital_params` for details on the generated format and
how to register the array with the SDK.


Initializing the Hubble Device SDK
**********************************

Once time, location, and orbital parameters are available, initialize the SDK
before calling any other Hubble API:

.. code-block:: c

   /*
    * At this point unix_time_ms, device_pos, and orb_params are assumed to be
    * valid. Either baked into firmware or received via BLE provisioning.
    */
   err = hubble_init(unix_time_ms, master_key);
   if (err != 0) {
       LOG_ERR("Failed to initialize Hubble Device SDK (err %d)", err);
       return err;
   }

   err = hubble_sat_satellites_set(orb_params, orb_params_count);
   if (err != 0) {
       LOG_ERR("Failed to set orbital parameters (err %d)", err);
       return err;
   }

:c:func:`hubble_init` takes the current Unix time in milliseconds and a
pointer to the master key. :c:func:`hubble_sat_satellites_set` registers the
orbital parameters array with the SDK.

.. warning::

   * **The key buffer MUST remain valid for the lifetime of SDK usage.** The
     SDK stores the pointer directly and does not copy the key. Do not use a
     stack or temporary buffer.
   * **Unix time must be non-zero.** Passing ``0`` in
     ``CONFIG_HUBBLE_COUNTER_SOURCE_UNIX_TIME`` mode returns an error.
   * **The orbital parameters array MUST remain valid** for as long as pass
     prediction is used. The SDK stores a pointer and does not copy the array.


The Pass Prediction Loop
************************

With the SDK initialized, the application enters the main dual-stack loop:
compute the next satellite pass, beacon over BLE while waiting, stop BLE,
transmit to the satellite, then repeat.

Compute the Next Pass
=====================

.. code-block:: c

   /*
    * Before this loop, make sure that the Bluetooth stack has been
    * properly initialized by calling bt_init()
    */
   for (;;) {
       now_ms = hubble_time_get();

       err = hubble_sat_next_pass_get(now_ms, &device_pos, &pass_info);
       if (err != 0) {
           LOG_ERR("Failed to get next pass (err %d)", err);
           return err;
       }

       /* If the pass has already started, find the next one. */
       if (pass_info.start <= now_ms) {
           err = hubble_sat_next_pass_get(
               pass_info.start + pass_info.duration,
               &device_pos, &pass_info);
           if (err != 0) {
               LOG_ERR("Failed to get next pass (err %d)", err);
               return err;
           }
       }

:c:func:`hubble_sat_next_pass_get` returns the soonest pass visible from the
device location. If ``pass_info.start`` is already in the past, a pass is in
progress, skip it and compute the next one by searching from after its end
(``pass_info.start + pass_info.duration``).

Beacon over BLE While Waiting
==============================

Start a timer for the pass window and begin BLE advertising while the device
waits:

.. code-block:: c

       k_timer_start(&sat_timer, K_MSEC(pass_info.start - now_ms),
                     K_NO_WAIT);

       /*
        * Enable Bluetooth by calling bt_enable(), get the Hubble beacon
        * payload via hubble_ble_advertise_get() and start BLE advertising
        * with bt_le_adv_start().
        */
       start_ble_advertising();

       /*
        * Block and wait until the pass timer fires. Common approaches are
        * a semaphore, task notification, or event flag.
        */
       block_until_timer_expires();

The timer callback signals the waiting thread when the pass window is overhead.

Transmit to the Satellite
==========================

Before transmitting, the BLE stack must be fully stopped to release the radio.
Call ``bt_le_adv_stop()`` to stop advertising, then ``bt_disable()`` to
disable the Bluetooth stack entirely. The satellite radio requires exclusive
access to the radio hardware:

.. code-block:: c

       /* Stop advertising and disable BLE to release the radio. */
       bt_le_adv_stop();
       bt_disable();

       err = hubble_sat_packet_get(&packet, NULL, 0);
       if (err != 0) {
           LOG_ERR("Failed to build packet (err %d)", err);
           return err;
       }

       /* Blocking call, retries are handled internally by the SDK */
       err = hubble_sat_packet_send(&packet, HUBBLE_SAT_RELIABILITY_NORMAL);
       if (err != 0) {
           LOG_ERR("Failed to send packet (err %d)", err);
           return err;
       }
   } /* end while loop, back to compute the next pass, re-enable bluetooth, and beacon */

:c:func:`hubble_sat_packet_send` is blocking. It returns only after the full
transmission sequence completes, including all retries. See
:ref:`hubble_satellite_reliability` for guidance on reliability modes and
their effect on power consumption.


Building and Flashing
**********************

Build your application with the ``ncs-dual-stack`` snippet. This snippet is
required for all NCS applications using the Hubble dual-stack. It enables
the Multiprotocol Service Layer (MPSL) for BLE and satellite radio coexistence:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p -b <your_board> <your_app> -S ncs-dual-stack
   west flash


Verifying the Application
**************************

Enable the Hubble Device SDK logging by adding the following to ``prj.conf``:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   CONFIG_LOG=y
   CONFIG_HUBBLE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y

Open a serial terminal to the device at 115200 baud (e.g. ``nrfutil``,
``minicom`` or any serial terminal application).

Expected SDK Log Output
=======================

After a successful :c:func:`hubble_init` call, the SDK logs:

.. code-block:: none

   <inf> hubblenetwork: Hubble Device SDK initialized

At debug level, once pass prediction runs and a transmission is scheduled, you
will see the retry count computed from your TDR setting and the time elapsed
since the last sync:

.. code-block:: none

   <dbg> hubblenetwork: Time drift since last sync: 20000 ms
   <dbg> hubblenetwork: Number of additional retries due TDR: 1
   <dbg> hubblenetwork: Number of retries: 9 - interval: 20 seconds

After :c:func:`hubble_sat_packet_send` completes the full transmission
sequence:

.. code-block:: none

   <inf> hubblenetwork: Hubble Satellite packet sent

If this line appears without any preceding ``<err>`` or ``<wrn>`` from the
``hubblenetwork`` module, the device has successfully transmitted to the
satellite network. For RF-level verification using an SDR, see
:ref:`Next Steps <ncs_sat_next_steps>`.


Troubleshooting
***************

Build fails with missing library
=================================

**Symptom:** Linker error referencing a missing ``hubblenetwork`` or satellite
radio library.

**Cause:** West blobs were not fetched.

**Fix:**

.. code-block:: bash

   west blobs fetch hubblenetwork-sdk

``hubble_init`` returns an error
=================================

**Symptom:** ``<wrn> hubblenetwork: Failed to set Unix Epoch time``

**Cause:** ``unix_time_ms`` passed to :c:func:`hubble_init` is ``0``.
The SDK requires a valid non-zero Unix timestamp.

**Fix:** Ensure time is provisioned (over BLE, NTP, GPS, or RTC) before
calling :c:func:`hubble_init`. See :ref:`ncs_sat_data_requirements`.

---

**Symptom:** ``<wrn> hubblenetwork: Failed to set key``

**Cause:** The key buffer is NULL, zero-length, or the wrong size for the
configured key type (``CONFIG_HUBBLE_NETWORK_KEY_128`` or
``CONFIG_HUBBLE_NETWORK_KEY_256``).

**Fix:** Verify the key is correctly decoded and its length matches
``CONFIG_HUBBLE_KEY_SIZE``.

Pass prediction returns an error
=================================

**Symptom:** ``<wrn> hubblenetwork: Hubble Satellite next pass get: no satellites configured``

**Cause:** :c:func:`hubble_sat_satellites_set` was not called before
:c:func:`hubble_sat_next_pass_get`.

**Fix:** Call :c:func:`hubble_sat_satellites_set` with a valid orbital
parameters array immediately after :c:func:`hubble_init`.

---

**Symptom:** ``<wrn> hubblenetwork: Hubble Satellite next pass get: no pass found``

**Cause:** No satellite pass is visible from the given location within the
search window. Most commonly caused by incorrect device coordinates or a
stale Unix timestamp.

**Fix:** Verify that ``device_pos.lat`` and ``device_pos.lon`` are correct
and that ``unix_time_ms`` reflects current wall-clock time.

---

**Symptom:** Firmware appears to hang or stall inside
:c:func:`hubble_sat_next_pass_get`.

**Cause:** The pass prediction algorithm iterates forward orbit-by-orbit until
it finds a pass. If the input time is near zero (e.g. Unix time was passed in
**seconds** instead of **milliseconds**), or if ``device_pos.lat``
and ``device_pos.lon`` are invalid, the loop can spin
through thousands of orbits before returning.

**Fix:** Confirm ``unix_time_ms`` is in **milliseconds** and that
``device_pos.lat`` and ``device_pos.lon`` hold the actual device coordinates.

Transmission fails
==================

**Symptom:** ``<wrn> hubblenetwork: Hubble Satellite packet transmission failed``

**Cause:** The board API returned an error from
:c:func:`hubble_sat_board_packet_send`, or the BLE stack was still active
when :c:func:`hubble_sat_packet_send` was called.

**Fix:** Ensure ``bt_le_adv_stop()`` and ``bt_disable()`` are called before
:c:func:`hubble_sat_packet_send`. If the error comes from the board API,
check your PA/FEM GPIO sequencing in
:c:func:`hubble_sat_board_packet_send`.

---

**Symptom:** ``<err> hubblenetwork: Hubble Satellite Network initialization failed``

**Cause:** :c:func:`hubble_sat_board_init` returned an error during SDK
initialization, common cause is the board init failed.

**Fix:** Check the return value of :c:func:`hubble_sat_board_init` in your
board implementation.


.. _ncs_sat_next_steps:

Next Steps
**********

RF Verification with an SDR
============================

Before waiting for a live satellite pass, you can verify that your device is
transmitting a valid Hubble packet at the physical layer using an
`ADALM-PLUTO product page`_ and the `pyhubblenetwork`_ Python library.

Install the library:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyhubblenetwork

Connect the ADALM-PLUTO near the device antenna and run the scanner with your
device key to decode captured packets in real time:

.. code-block:: bash

   hubblenetwork sat scan --key "<your-device-key>"

A successfully decoded packet confirms the RF output, packet framing, channel
hopping sequence, and PA/FEM sequencing are all correct. For the full list of
available commands, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   hubblenetwork --help

See the `pyhubblenetwork`_ repository for detailed usage and setup
instructions.

Viewing Upcoming Passes
========================

Use the **Hubble Pass Explorer** on the `Hubble Dashboard`_ to see when the
next satellite pass is predicted for your location. This is useful to
cross-check pass prediction results from the device and to plan test windows.

Dashboard Verification
======================

Once a live satellite pass has occurred and :c:func:`hubble_sat_packet_send`
returned without error, after the downlink data is successful, log into the
`Hubble Dashboard`_ to confirm the packet was received by the network. A packet
appearing on the dashboard is end-to-end proof that the device is operational
on the Hubble satellite network.
