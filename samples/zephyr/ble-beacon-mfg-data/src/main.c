 * Hubble Network BLE Beacon + Manufacturer Data sample.
 *
 * This sample shows how to emit a SINGLE BLE advertisement that contains both
 * the standard Hubble beacon payload AND an application-owned
 * "manufacturer specific data" field. The manufacturer field carries a 4-byte
 * counter that is incremented every time the advertisement is refreshed
 * (every CONFIG_HUBBLE_MFG_DATA_SAMPLE_UPDATE_PERIOD seconds, 5 minutes by
 * default).
 *
 * The advertisement is built from three AD (Advertising Data) structures:
 *
 *   [1] BT_DATA_UUID16_ALL      -> 0xFCA6, the Hubble service UUID. This is how
 *                                  Hubble gateways recognize the beacon.
 *   [2] BT_DATA_SVC_DATA16      -> the encrypted Hubble payload produced by
 *                                  hubble_ble_advertise_get(). The buffer
 *                                  already starts with the 0xFCA6 service UUID.
 *   [3] BT_DATA_MANUFACTURER_DATA -> application data. By BLE convention this
 *                                  field starts with a 2-byte company
 *                                  identifier; here we reuse Hubble's 0xFCA6
 *                                  identifier (little-endian) followed by a
 *                                  4-byte little-endian counter.
 *
 * Advertisement size note: legacy BLE advertising allows 31 payload bytes.
 * This sample passes no Hubble user payload (NULL, 0), so the Hubble service
 * data is 12 bytes and the whole advertisement is ~26 bytes -- well under the
 * limit. If you add Hubble user payload (up to 13 bytes) it shares the same
 * 31-byte budget with the manufacturer field, so they cannot both be maxed.
 *
 * Key provisioning: the Hubble master key is passed on the build command line
 * as base64 (west build ... -- -DHUBBLE_KEY="<key>") and decoded to a byte
 * array at build time (see CMakeLists.txt), so no base64 code runs on the
 * device. No pre-build script is required.
