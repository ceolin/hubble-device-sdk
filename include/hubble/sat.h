 * It tells what is the desired reliability when transmitting
 * a packet. Higher reliability consumes higher power because it increases the
 * number of retries.
 *
 * @note The retry counts listed below are baselines. Extra retries are
 *       added to compensate for the device's clock drift accumulated since
 *       the last time synchronization: one additional retry is added for
 *       every full retransmission interval worth of drift. The longer the
 *       device goes without synchronizing its clock, the more retries are
 *       performed. Modes with no retries (@ref HUBBLE_SAT_RELIABILITY_NONE)
 *       are not affected.
 *
 *       The drift is estimated from the device's Time Drift Rate (TDR),
 *       configured through @c CONFIG_HUBBLE_SAT_NETWORK_DEVICE_TDR and
 *       expressed in parts per million (PPM). The accumulated drift is
 *       computed as (time since last sync) * TDR, so a higher TDR yields
 *       more additional retries for the same elapsed time.
